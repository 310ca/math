## Operations on Sets

### 1. Union

The union of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) is the set of elements which are in \(A\), in \(B\), or in both \(A\) and \(B\).

\[ A \cup B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \} \]

### 2. Intersection

The intersection of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) is the set of elements which are both in \(A\) and in \(B\).

\[ A \cap B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ and } x \in B \} \]

### 3. Difference

The difference of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) is the set of elements which are in \(A\) but not in \(B\).

\[ A - B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ and } x \notin B \} \]

### 4. Complement

The complement of a set \(A\) with respect to a universal set \(U\) is the set of elements which are in \(U\) but not in \(A\).

\[ A' = \{ x : x \in U \text{ and } x \notin A \} \]

### 5. Symmetric Difference

The symmetric difference of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) is the set of elements which are in either of the sets and not in their intersection.

\[ A \Delta B = \{ x : x \in A \text{ or } x \in B \text{ but not both } \} \]

### 6. Cartesian Product

The Cartesian product of two sets \(A\) and \(B\) is the set of all ordered pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a\) is in \(A\) and \(b\) is in \(B\).

\[ A \times B = \{ (a, b) : a \in A \text{ and } b \in B \} \]

### 7. Power Set

The power set of a set \(A\) is the set of all subsets of \(A\).

\[ P(A) = \{ X : X \subseteq A \} \]

### 8. Subset

A set \(A\) is a subset of set \(B\) if every element of \(A\) is also an element of \(B\).

\[ A \subseteq B \]

### 9. Proper Subset

A set \(A\) is a proper subset of set \(B\) if \(A\) is a subset of \(B\) but \(A\) is not equal to \(B\).

\[ A \subset B \]
